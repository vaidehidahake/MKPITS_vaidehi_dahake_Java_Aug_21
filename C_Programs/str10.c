//Once a string is defined, it cannot be reassigned to another set of characters. However, using pointers, we can assign the set of characters to the string. Consider the following example.

#include<stdio.h>  
    void main ()  
    {  
        char *p = "hello mkpits";  
        printf("Before assigning: %s\n",p);  
        p = "hello";  
        printf("After assigning: %s\n",p);  
    }
