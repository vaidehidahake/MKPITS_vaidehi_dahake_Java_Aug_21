    <p>
        firstly, in a large bowl take 2 cup wheat flour, 1 cup maida, ¼ tsp turmeric, ¼ tsp salt and 2 tbsp oil.
        mix well making sure all the ingredients are well combined.
        now add water as required and start to knead the dough.
        knead to a smooth and soft dough adding water in batches.
        grease the dough with 2 tsp oil, cover and rest for at least 1 hour.
        after 1 hour, punch and knead the dough again.
        pinch a ball sized dough and make a smooth ball.
        form a cup by pressing the dough from the sides.
        place a ball sized prepared puran (dal stuff).
        start to stuff inside by pulling the dough without having any pleats.
        now seal the dough without any cracks.
        dust the ball with maida and flatten slightly.
        now roll the holige gently, without putting much pressure.
        roll as thin as possible and making sure the puran is distributed uniformly.
        now cook the puran poli on hot tawa keeping the flame on medium.
        flip over once the base is half cooked.
        spread the ghee on both sides and cook well.
        puff the puran poli, making sure to cook uniformly
        finally, enjoy puran poli with ghee or milk.
